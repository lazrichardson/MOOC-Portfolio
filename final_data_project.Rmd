## Setup

### Load packages

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

### Load data

```{r load-data}
load("brfss2013.RData")
```

## Part 1: Data

Data for this analysis is taken from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System or BRFSS. The BRFSS is a US state based random dialed telephone survey of individuals aged >= 18 years who live in the United States. 

The dataset hasnâ€™t been collected using simple random sampling. Instead, it was collected using a more complex sampling method. Based on the qualifiers above, it should be understood that any results of this analysis cannot be generalized to the entire US population. Only the population of individuals who are US residents, >= age 18, and have ownership or access to a home landline or cellular phone could have results of analysis generalized to it.

In order to ensure that results are accurate and generalizable one needs to be sure that very specific subgroups such as specific geographic area have a large enough sample size, one greater than 50 records according to BRFSS guidelines.

## Part 2: Research questions

**Research quesion 1:**
Question: Which state has the highest mean sleep time, and does this state have better or worse on mental and physical health days on average than all states and territories surveyed? This question seeks to see if there is a relationship between sleep, as well as physical and mental health. There are many studies showing poorer sleep can affect your health. I am curious to see if this result will be shown in this dataset.

**Research quesion 2:**
Question: Of those who gave a yes or no response to the question, is the probability that a college educated individual in the survey will have a cell phone for personal use higher or lower than one who has a GED? I am curious to see if there is a relationship between college education and education level.

**Research quesion 3:**
What is the probability that a randomly selected survey respondent in Massachusetts exercised in the last 30 days, is this greater or lower than all states, and what the most likely exercise this individual would be doing? Massachusetts has reputation as a healthy state, and I would like to see if survey respondents are more likely to have exercised here than across the US as a whole as well as what type of exercise they're likely to have done recently.

#It appears that there may be a relationship between sleep and sick days as well as bad physical days
